        <p>
          Design is much more than it&#39;s visual representation. It is product
          whole vision from the onset. My practice is based on a multifaceted
          approach where technical discovery is emphasized and functionality and
          aesthetic are in balance.

        <p>
          I focus on bringing vision to reality. Think, do, try, repeatâ€¦ There&apos;s no magic trick involved. I care about strategy just as much as I
          care about the craft. My process focuses on defining a clear goal and working relentlessly to reach it.
